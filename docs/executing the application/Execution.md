## Shell Commands/Shell Scripting

Commands | Function
---------|----------
pwd      | print/present working directory
cd       | change directory
         | with this command - because we have to pass an argument (the path to the directory we wish to change to)
         | this invites two different ways to specify the path we wish to change to
         | *aboslute path* describes the path from the root directory(slash /) any path that begins with / implies root directory
         | *relative path* - this command describes the path from where you are _currently_ 
         _shortcuts_
         | cd . -> current directory you are in
         | cd .. -> outer/parent/encapsulating directory
         | cd ~ -> home directory
         | cd - -> previous directory that you were in 
ls       |list directories in the current directory or within the directory you pass to it as argument
